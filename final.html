                    <p>estimates of the number of Swahili speakers, including both native and second language speakers, vary widely.</p>
                    <p>They generally rangen from 60 million to 150 million; with most of its native speakers residing in Tanzania.</p>

                        <h3>The Origin of Swahili</h3>
                        <!--Link to page 26-->
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language#cite_note-26">go to page 26</a>
                        <p> The core of the Swahili language originates in<a href="clickable text">Bantu language</a> of thr coast of East Africa.
                        Much of Swahili's Bantu vocabulary has congnates in the <a href=" clicksble text"><span style="color:red;">Unguja</span></a>,<a href="clickable text">Pemba</a> and <a href="clickable text">Mijikenda languages<a href="clickable text">[25]</a>
                    and, to a lesser extent, other <a href="clickable text">East African Bantu languages</a>.
                While opinions vary on the specifics, it has been Historical purported that around 16-20% of the Swahili vocabulary is derived from loan words , the vast majority <a href="clickable text">Arabic</a>, but also other contributing languages, including<a href="clickable text">Persian</a>, <a href="clickable text">Hindustani</a>,
            <a href="clickable text">Portuguese</a>, and <a href="clickable text">Malay</a>. <a href="clickable text">[26]</a></p>
                        <p>
                            <a href="clickable text">Omani Arabic</a> is the source of most Arabic loanwords in Swahili.<a href="clickable text">[28][29]</a> In the text "Early Swahili Hirstory Reconsidered".
                             However, Thomas Spaer noted that Swahili retains a large amount of grammar, vocabuilary, and sounds inherited from the <a href="clickable text">Sabaki language</a>.
                              In fact, while taking account of daily vocabulary, using lists of one hundred words, 72-91% were inherited from the <a href="clickable text">Sabaki language</a> ( which is reported as a parent language)
                            whereas 4-17% were loan words from other African languages.
                            Only 2-8% were fom none-African languages, and Arabic loan words constituted a fraction of that.
                            According to other sources, around 40% of the Swahili vocabulary comes from Arabic.
                            What also remained unconsidered was that a good number of the borrowed terms had Bantu equivalents.
                            </p>
                            <p>Swahili has a significant number of <a href="clickable text">loanwords</a> from other languages, mainly <a href="clickable text">Arabic</a>, as well as from <a href="clickable text">Portuguese</a>, <a href="clickable text">English</a> and <a href="clickable text">German</a>.
                                Around 40% od Swahili vocabulary consists of Arabic loanwords, including the name of the language
                                (sawahili a plural adjectival form of an Arabic word meaning 'of the coasts")
                            </p>

                        <p>The preferred use of Arabic loan words is prevalent along the coast, where local people, in a cultural show of proximity to, or descent from Arab culture,
                             would rather use loan words, whereas the people in the interior tend to use the Bantu equivalents.
                            It was originally written in Arabic script.
                            <p>The earliest known documents written in Swhaili are letters written in <a href="clickable text">Kilwa,
                                Tanzania,</a> in 1711 in the Arabic script that were sent to the portuguese of
                                Mozambique and thier local allies. The original letters are preserved in the Historical Archibes of Goa, India.

                        <h3>Colonial period</h3>
                        <p>Various colonial powers that ruled on the coast of East Africa played a role in the growth and spread of Swahili.
                        With the arrival The Arabs in East Africa, they used Swahili as Language of trade as well as for teaching laslam to the local <a href="clickable text">Bantu peoples.</a>
                        This resulted in Swahili first being writtrn in Arabic script. The later contact with the 
                        portuguese resulted in the increase of vocabulary of the Swahili language.
                        The language was formslised in an institutional level when the Germans took over after the <a href="clickable text
                        ">Berlin conference.</a>After seeing there was already a widespread language, the Germans formalised it as the official language to be used in schools.
                        Thus schools in Swahili are called shule (from German schule) in government, trade and the court system.
                        with the Germans controlling the major Swahili speaking region in East Africa,they changed the alphabet system from Arabic to Latin.
                        After the first, World War, Britsin took over German East Africa, where they found Swahili rooted in most areas,
                        not just the coastal regions.

                            <p>The British decided to formalise it as the language to be used aross the East African 
                                region (althought in <a href="clickable text">British East Africa</a> [Kenya and Uganda]
                                most areas used English and various Nilotic and other Bantu languages while Swahili was mostly restricted to thr coast).
                            In june 1928, an inter-territorial conference attended by representatives of <a href="clickable text">Kenya, Tanganika, Ugnada,</a> and <a href="clickable text">Zanzibar</a>
                        took place in <a href="clickable text">Mombasa</a>. The Zanzibar dialect was chosen as <a href="clickable text">standard Swahili</a> for those areas, <a href="clickable text">[36]</a> and the standard orthography for Swahili was adopted.<a href="clickable text">[37]</a>

                        <div>
                            <h3>Swahili Orthography</h3>
                            <p>Swahili is now written in the Latin alphabet. There are a few <a href="clickable text">digraphs</a>
                            for native sounds, ch. sh, ng' and ny; and x are not used, <a href="clickable text">[65]</a> 
                        c is not used apart from the digraph ch, unassimilated English loans and, occasionally, as substitute for k in advertisements.
                    There are also several digrahps for Arabic sounds, which many speakers outisde of ethnic Swahili areas have trouble differentiating.
                The language used to be primsrily written in the Ajami script, which is an Arabic script. Much literature as produced in this script. With the introduction of Latin,
            the use of Ajami script has been diminished significantly. However, the language continues to have a tradition of being written in Arabic script. <a href="clickable text">[66]
                Starting from the later half of the 19th centurty, continuing into the 20th centurty, and going on in the 21st centurty, a process of "Swahilization" of the Arabic 
                script has been underway by Swahili scribes and scholars, The first of such attemps was done by <a href="clickable text">Mwalimu Sikujua</a>, a scholar and poet from <a href="clickable text">
                    Mombasa. [67]</a>
                However, the spread of a standardized infigenous varition of Arabic script for Swahili was hampered by the colonial takeover of East Africa by <a href="clickable text" >
                    the United Kingdom</a> and <a href="clickable text">Germany</a>. The usage of Arabic script was suppressed in <a href="clickable text">German East Africa</a>
                    and to a lesser extent in <a href="clickable text">British East Africa</a>. Nevertheless, well into the 1930s and 1940s, rurql literacy rate in Arabic script as well
                    as a local preference to write in Swahili in the Arabic script (an unmodified version as opposed to proposals such as that of Mwalimu Sikujua) was
                    relatively high. <a href="clickable text">[67]</a> There were also differences in orthgraphic conventions between cities and authors and over the centuries,
                    some quite precise but others different enough to cause diffulties with intelligibility. Thus despite a lack of official governmental backing, attemos at standardization and Swahilization of the Arabic continuesd into the 20th century.
